Description:
We will be exploring data using the National Park Service API.  
We will be using Folium to create a map to visualize our data in an interactive way.
The data we will pull is the National Parks campgrounds.
We will utilize web scraping to include other data points from the following website:
https://www.geographyrealm.com/map-and-geography-trivia-u-s-national-parks/
We will scrape a table of the list of the establishment dates for national parks in the US.  
We will create an interactive model by using the  hover feature within the map to display the data we found for each National Park.
These maps will enable users to easily find information about campgrounds and park establishment dates for national parks around the US. 

Process:
To achieve our endstate of a map visualization with hoverable data points which the end-user can interact with, we will follow the steps below. 
Extract data on the campgrounds using the National Park Service API. We will also scrape a table on the establishment dates of parks around the US. 
The above data (in JSON and CSV format) will then be imported into a database using MongoDB. 
We will then visualize the data using Folium, creating an interactive map with hoverable data points that provides amplifying information on points of interest.
